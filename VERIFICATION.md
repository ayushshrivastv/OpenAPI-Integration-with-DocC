# Verification Guide for Security Scheme Fixes

This guide provides instructions for verifying the security scheme integration fixes in the OpenAPI-to-DocC project.

## Prerequisites

- Swift 5.9 or later
- macOS or Linux environment

## Verification Steps

1. **Build the Project**

```bash
swift build
```

2. **Run the Test Script**

```bash
chmod +x TestExamples/test-security-fixes.swift
./TestExamples/test-security-fixes.swift
```

3. **Manual Verification**

For a more thorough verification:

```bash
# Generate DocC catalog from test API
swift run openapi-tool to-docc --output-directory ./output test-api.yaml

# Check if security schemes are properly included
grep -r "securitySchemes" ./output

# Generate full documentation
xcrun docc convert output/TestAPI.docc --fallback-display-name TestAPI --fallback-bundle-identifier com.example.TestAPI --fallback-bundle-version 1.0.0 --output-path ./docs

# Serve the documentation locally
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory ./docs
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser to verify the security scheme documentation.

## Fixed Issues Verification

### 1. Model Alignment

- The Components struct now includes securitySchemes property
- SecurityScheme model supports all OpenAPI security scheme types
- Schemas include format, enum, and example properties

### 2. Build System

- Package.resolved file is now properly formatted as JSON
- No backup files exist that could interfere with the build

### 3. Integration

- generateAuthenticationCode method properly handles all security scheme types
- Schema type determination works with all format types
- Example extraction is now supported for all schema types

## Test API

A test API specification (test-api.yaml) has been provided that includes:

- Multiple security schemes (Bearer, API Key, OAuth2)
- Schemas with examples and enum values
- Various string formats (date-time, uuid, email)

Use this file to verify that all fixed features work correctly.

## Expected Results

When everything is working correctly:

1. The build should complete without errors
2. The test script should show all checks passing
3. The generated documentation should include security scheme information
4. Examples should be rendered in the documentation
5. Schema formats should be properly mapped to Swift types
