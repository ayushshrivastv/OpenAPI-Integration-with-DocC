# Changes to Resolve Compatibility Issues

This document outlines the changes made to resolve compatibility issues between the codebase and the current versions of OpenAPIKit and SymbolKit libraries.

## Issues Addressed

1. **SymbolKit Type References**
   - Fixed incorrect namespace references for SymbolKit types like AccessLevel, DocumentationComment, etc.
   - Updated initialization parameters for SymbolKit types to match current API requirements

2. **OpenAPIKit Integration**
   - Added compatibility layer through extensions to bridge API differences
   - Created property wrappers to maintain backward compatibility with the codebase's expectations

3. **JSONSchema Pattern Matching**
   - Fixed pattern matching in switch statements for JSONSchema composite types
   - Corrected access for schemas in allOf, anyOf, oneOf and not cases

## File Changes

### 1. SymbolMapping.swift
- Fixed qualified type names for SymbolKit types
- Updated initialization of TypeInformation, GenericParameter, etc.
- Fixed case handling for composite type extraction
- Corrected line list and documentation comment handling

### 2. New File: OpenAPIKitExtensions.swift
Created a new file with extensions to provide backward compatibility:
- Added example type compatibility wrapper
- Extended OpenAPI.Operation with operationId and security accessors
- Extended OpenAPI.Parameter with description accessor
- Extended OpenAPI.Document.Info with contact information

### 3. DocCCatalogGenerator.swift
- Updated Example type usage with compatibility layer
- No direct changes needed as the extension layer handles compatibility

## Build and Test

To build and test the fixed codebase:

1. Ensure you have Swift 5.7 or later installed
2. Run `swift build` in the project directory
3. Test with one of the OpenAPI examples:
   ```
   swift run openapi-to-symbolgraph Examples/petstore.yaml --output ./output
   ```

## Future Considerations

If updating OpenAPIKit in the future, consider:
1. Checking for any new API changes that might affect the compatibility layer
2. Reviewing and possibly removing the extensions in OpenAPIKitExtensions.swift
3. Updating direct usage patterns to match the latest OpenAPIKit API
