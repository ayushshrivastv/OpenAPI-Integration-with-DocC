# Utilities

This directory contains various utility classes and functions used throughout the OpenAPI to SymbolGraph conversion process.

## Structure

- `DocC/` - Utilities specific to DocC documentation generation

## Purpose

The utilities in this directory are designed to:

1. Provide common functionality used across different modules
2. Encapsulate specific functionality that doesn't belong in the core conversion process
3. Keep the main codebase clean and focused on the primary task
4. Provide extension points for future functionality

These utilities enhance the overall functionality of the converter while maintaining separation of concerns.
