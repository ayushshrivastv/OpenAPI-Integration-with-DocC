# DocC Utilities

This directory contains utilities for working with DocC documentation.

## Contents

- `DocCGenerator.swift` - Utilities for generating DocC documentation from SymbolGraph files

## Responsibilities

The DocC utilities are responsible for:

1. Creating DocC-compatible catalog structures
2. Generating markdown documentation files
3. Providing utilities for running DocC commands
4. Formatting documentation in DocC-friendly ways
5. Enhancing the generated documentation with additional context and examples

These utilities help bridge the gap between the SymbolGraph representation and the final DocC documentation.
