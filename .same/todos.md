# Project Tasks

## Current Issues

- [completed] Review and fix SymbolMapping.swift
  - Corrected SymbolKit type usages (specifically for AccessLevel, DocumentationComment, Line.Fragment, TypeInformation)
  - Ensured correct usage of Swift.TypeInformation.Kind references (.struct, .enum, etc.)
  - Fixed the case statements for allOf, anyOf, oneOf, not to correctly extract schemas and context values
  - Updated GenericParameter initialization with the correct parameter order

- [completed] Create a fix strategy for OpenAPIKit property access:
  - Created extension methods/properties in a new OpenAPIKitExtensions.swift file
  - Implemented compatibility layers for all the necessary types

- [completed] Address issues in DocCCatalogGenerator.swift
  - Added compatibility extensions for `operation.operationId`
  - Added compatibility extensions for `document.info.contact`
  - Added compatibility extensions for `parameter.description`
  - Added compatibility extensions for `operation.security`
  - Added compatibility wrapper for the Example type and updated formatExamples method

- [in_progress] Complete the project
  - ⚠️ Swift installation in Docker container is challenging
  - All code fixes have been made, but building is not possible in the current environment
  - The changes should resolve the issues identified in the initial description

## Summary of Changes Made

1. Fixed SymbolMapping.swift:
   - Corrected type references for SymbolKit classes and structures
   - Updated parameter orders and initializers to match SymbolKit's API
   - Fixed JSONSchema pattern matching for composite types (allOf, anyOf, oneOf, not)

2. Created compatibility layer (OpenAPIKitExtensions.swift):
   - Added extensions for OpenAPIKit types to bridge API differences
   - Implemented property accessors needed by our code (operationId, description, etc.)
   - Created compatibility wrapper for the Example type

3. Fixed DocCCatalogGenerator.swift:
   - Updated the Example type usage with our compatibility wrapper
   - All accessor issues have been addressed via the extension methods

## Recommendations for Building and Testing

1. The project should be built in an environment with Swift 5.7 or later installed
2. After building, test with one of the example OpenAPI files in the Examples directory
3. The command line should be similar to: `swift run openapi-to-symbolgraph <openapi-file> --output <output-dir>`

## Completed Tasks

- [completed] Clone the repository
- [completed] Examine project structure and dependencies
- [completed] Identify specific issues in the code
- [completed] Fix all code compatibility issues
